# Treating Kong's Ant Bite

Today, we treated Kong for an ant bite on his paw. Here's what we did:

1. **Assessment:** We noticed Kong was licking his paw excessively and saw a small red bump.
2. **Cleaning:** We cleaned the affected area with a gentle antiseptic solution.
3. **Treatment:** We applied a topical antibiotic ointment to the bite.
4. **Bandaging:** Finally, we wrapped his paw with a light bandage to prevent further irritation.

Kong was very cooperative and is now resting comfortably.
